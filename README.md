## Pumkin Seeds
===========
### I have not updated in some time. Working too much, me thinks. But I am working on a bunch of updates and upgrades right now. I hope to push them soon.

A Basic Event Driven JS Framework to get any website going fast. It's just a scaffolding using various popular and solid Web technologies I use often.

**Work in progress on Version 1.5 - it's not ready for consumption just yet. It's still very much Alpha/Pre-Alpha code still in the design stages. But it's fun to watch things grow.

## Why Pumpkin Seeds - PKS?

As a front-end who has on more than a few occasions needed to lay down the basic architecture for scalable, high traffic sites, it is good to choose the right technologies quickly. Time is money and we don't often have the luxury of trying out new and trendy libraries in all the various combinations possible. We would never get stuff done. 

PKS is a proven scaffolding I have used to solve the problems of
* We need something fast
** Bonus!
+ ** Event Driven MVC and OOJS patterns
* Can we prototype this first? 
* Uses Open Source - We don't want to reinvent the wheel
* Documentation, Documentation... RTFM 'Careful who yo usay that too. It might get you fired. But it may be worth it' 
* Great standards
* Cross-Browser and Mobile frinedly 
** But we could care less about IE 6 anymore. If you are still supporting it you are wasting $$$$$$
* Scalable, Flexible and Maintainable
* Easy for new developers to understand and get up and running if you get hit by a bus
* Nurf War Friendly

## Future Integrations
* Handlebars 
* Backbone

## Usage - Twiter Bootstrap 

Bootstrap and other similar CSS libraries are an AWESOME was yo start fast. PKS uses Bootstrap as teh foundation. The PKS solution is an example of how to use Bootstrap and your own CSS/LESS files to override the parent. You could simply use Bootstrap, customize it to your needs and never upgrade again. PKS leave upgrade to newer version as an option with the least mount of pain. 

## jQuery

Is our frined. I have used many JS libraries and none come close to the flexibility and ease of use as JQ. It fits "my" style of programmin. 

## Digg Class
And you thought Digg was dead. Well they managed to leave behind a rather nice and simple little morsel named Class. It is the smallest and simplest library abvailable for "Native" Class creation in jQuery similar to Prototype and Mootools. While the project is no longer maintained or available in GitHub as indicated I still use it with great appreciation. Yes there are other ways but none is a small and clean as Digg's implimentaion. 

## JsViews and JsRender by Boris Moore
This is another GREAT Gem. Face it jQuery's template solution was and is not up to par. It's also on agian and off again. Boris created the "Next Generation" of JS Tempaltes for jQuery and honestly they are pretty darn sharp. I have been using this solution for a while year without fail. There are other solutions. But remember that bullet list above? We need something NOW. 

## More to Come
